# Learning with Texts

> [Learning with Texts](https://sourceforge.net/projects/learning-with-texts) (LWT) is a tool for Language Learning using texts.

This is an intricated fork by [@HugoFara](https://github.com/hugofara/lwt). As a GitHub fork, it comes from [@chaosarium's fork (archived)](https://github.com/chaosarium/lwt-fork)  of [@PirtleShell's fork](https://github.com/pirtleshell/lwt) of [@andreask7's fork](https://github.com/andreask7/lwt). It was also merged from the official LWT (as least until version 2.0.2), and many contributions from the community.

This version is quicker than this official, has many features not found in the original. It also looks more likely to develop communally, whereas the original is not open for contributions.

If the reading page displays a database error, try downgrading to PHP version 5.4.45.

[@gustavklopp's LingL](https://github.com/gustavklopp/LingL) is a wonderful alternative written in Python.

**THIS IS A THIRD PARTY VERSION**
IT DIFFERS IN MANY RESPECTS FROM THE OFFICIAL LWT-VERSION

## New in this Version (not available in the OFFICIAL LWT)

* Support for different themes
* Longer (>9) expressions can now be saved (up to 250 characters)
* Display translations of terms with status(es) in the reading frame

* Multiwords selection (click and hold on a word -> move to another word -> release mouse button)
* Key bindings work when you hover over a word
* Bulk translate new words in the reading frame
* Google api (use 'ggl.php' instead of '*http://translate.google.com' for Google Translate)
* Text to speech support (only words)
* Optional "ignore all" button in read texts
* New key bindings in the reading frame: T (translate sentence), P (pronounce term), G (edit term with Google Translate)
* Ability to change audio playback speed (doesn't work when using the flash plugin)
* Improved Search/Query for Words/Texts
